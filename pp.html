                    <p>Absolutely phenomenal experience at Pegah Salon! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a welcoming atmosphere. I opted for their Deluxe Pedicure and it was nothing short of luxurious. The attention to detail, the relaxing environment, and the skilled technician made for an unforgettable pampering session. My feet have never felt so rejuvenated, and the polish looks flawless. I've found my go-to nail salon and can't wait to return!                              </p>

                    <p>I visited Pegah Salon last week for a Classic Manicure and was quite impressed with the results. The salon was clean, the staff was professional, and the selection of polish colors was extensive. My nails looked great, and the manicure has held up well. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that I had to wait a bit longer than expected to be seen, even with an appointment. However, the quality of service once my session began more than made up for the wait. I'll definitely be back!</p>

                    <p>Pegah Salon has a lot of potential, but my experience was a bit mixed. The spa pedicure itself was enjoyable, and the technician did a good job with the nail work. However, I felt the service was a bit rushed, and the salon seemed understaffed for how busy it was. It was also a bit pricier than I anticipated. I appreciate the quality of the pedicure but hope for better timing and clearer communication about pricing next time.Overal , I had an great experience at this salon.</p>
